# Magic 

# The Roots

Magic is the energy of chaos as it is sourced from another world known as The Roots. The magical energy present in all things is known as Xylem. All things are magical, though in most things this magic is in small enough quantities that nothing comes of it.

Magic in large quantities dsirupts the natural rules of the universe. In places where magic is dense, a triangle has 4 sides and 2+2=11. As a result, complex things, such as living creatures or machinery start to break in the presence of large quantities of xylem.

# Runes

When enough xylem forms in one spot, often in trees, a rune is formed. A rune is a fist sized knot of roots with a word of chaos carved into it. These runes can be grafted onto the body to allow one to access magic.

Runes are specific. A rune is based on the word of chaos it contains, and all runes of that word are the same. As a result, all runes of the same type contain the same spells. For example, the rune *Fire* contains three spells: fireball, snuff, and smoke blanket. All versions of the *Fire* rune contain exactly these spells.

An ungrafted run takes up 1/2 of a slot.

# Spells

Spells are pure chaos, manifest in reality warping abilities formed from you the caster's personal xylem infused with that of the rune.

Once a spell is cast, it is permanently lost until the rune it is a part of is refreshed.

## Grafting Runes

Grafting a rune takes an hour of unimpeded effort.

To graft a rune, you must sacrifice an inventory slot and permanently lose 1 health. Then the rune becomes permanently a part of you and you can cast the spells within it.

## Refreshing Runes

The way to refresh a rune is dependant on the rune. For example, the *Fire* rune requries taking one health damage from a source of fire to refresh it.

When a rune is refreshed, all spells can be cast again. Spells that were not cast before refreshing do not gain a second casting. You may only ever cast a spell once per refresh.

## Magic and Alchemy

As magic is the antithesis of order, alchemy, which functions on strict rules and science, breaks down around magic.

For each rune you have grafted, alchemical items do 1 less damage and 1 less healing.

## Corruption

Runes are naturally corrupting, and grafting a rune permanently increases your corruption of a specified type by 1. See [corruption](corruption.md).
