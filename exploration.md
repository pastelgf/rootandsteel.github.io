# Exploration

## Time and Rounds

During Exploration, time is split into segments called rounds. Each round, every character will have time to perform some number of actions, depending on the scale of their exploration. Once everyone in the party has decided their course, time passes forward to the enxt round.

## Large Scale Exploration

During travel accross large regions of land, such as an entire duchy, rounds are 8 hours long, and a day consists of 3 rounds. Each round, every character gets 1 actions they can use to interact with their environment. In order for a character to gain the benefits of a rest, they must spend the third round each day sleeping, though they may spend up to two hours taking watch and still benefit.

Large scale travel can be represented in one of two ways: hexes or point-to-point.

In hex travel, the map is represented by a hexgrid, where each hex represents one rounds worth of travel, or 8 hours of walking (this travel pace accounts for time spent resting, eating, and doing other tasks). The party will decide whether they wish to move to another hex or explore the one they are in every round.

In point-to-point, the map is represented by a series of interlinked points. These points are seperated by distances of some number of rounds. As with hexes, each round the party decides where they wish to move, or if they wish to stay in their current location.

### Large Scale Actions.

**Forage or Hunt:** Character makes an Agility check. For each hit, they find a quarter slot worth of food. May only be performed once per day.

**Forage Runes:** Character makes a Lore check. For each hit, they find a rune. May only be performed once per day.

**Keep Watch:** Reduces the Omen roll by 1. May only be performed once per round.

**Hide Tracks:** Character makes an Agility check. On a hit, the party becoems impossible to track.

**Tend to the Horses:** Character tends to the animals. Animals will not flee if danger appears.

**Eagle Eyes:** Character makes an Agiltiy check. On a hit, they determine information about an adjacent hex or point that would otherwise be hidden to them.

**At the Read:** Character is ready for combat, and gain an additional action during the first round of any combat started during the round.

**Work:** Character works on a personal project, such as crafting or scribing. Results vary based on what they want.

## Small Scale Exploration

When the party stops to explore a location, they begin small scale exploration. Duriong small scale exploration, rounds represent 10 minute spans, and each character has 2 actions.

This scale of exploration is used in dungeons or similar points of interest, especially ones with the threat of danger. When the party enters a room of a dungeon, or an area of point of interest, they may perform actions in that area until everyone has done everything they wish. At the end of the round, they may choose to move.

Actions in small scale exploration are used to interact with things in the environment. For example, if the party enters a dungeon room filled with several book cases, a desk, and a rotted old chest, two charaters might spend an action to examing the bookcase, another two might spend an action to examine the desk, and all 4 might spend an aciton to examine the chest. The GM then goes through and describes these items for the players and allows them to fiddle with them until they are done and moves on to the next item. 

## The Omen

The Omen is a portent of bad news.

The Omen isa ticking clock that represents time before the next unplanned disaster happens. Often, the Omen represents a random encounter with enemies, but it can equally represent an earhtquake, an unexpected storm, a massive camp of bandits, or anything else equally good at throwing a wrench in the party's plans.

The Omen starts at 40 in safe places, 30 in moderately dangerous ones, and 20 in very dangerous ones. Each round, the GM rolls 2d6 and subtracts the roll from the Omen. When the Omen reaches 0, there is a portent of what is to come, but nothing dangerous happens yet, and the Omen is reset to 3. When the Omen drops into the negatives, bad things happen (GM's discretion).
