# Root and Steel

A ttrpg focused on free form roleplay, tactical combat, and interesting choices around equipment, all set in a dark but fantastical world.

## Free-form Roleplay

Simply rules that promote creative problem solving rather than simply rolling. Roll less, think more, but when you need to roll all the tools are available for making arbitrating quick and easy for both GM and player. Best of all, roleplay and combat aren't linked so that you don't feel punished for playing a smart fighter or a strong wizard.

## Tactical Combat

Combat with a heavy focus on positioning and outsmarting your opponents. You will almost always be outgunned, so its up to quick thinking and creative use of abilities to turn the tide into your favor. Combat is war, and you are likely to lose if you simply charge into battle and hope for the best.

## Equipment

Your character's abilities are primarily determiend by what they have in their hands. A fighter with a sword and shield plays fundamentally differently from a fighter with a greataxe, moreso than just small numerical changes. The equipment you take into combat determines what abilities you have access to in combat, so planning well is just as important as using your equipment well.
