# Creating a Character

1. Roll a background from the list [here](backgrounds.md)) and note down the backgrounds starting attributes and equipment. Also note down your unreadied equipment slots, which is equal to 10 + your might score.
2. Note down your starting combat attributes:
   - 12 Hitpoints
   - 6 Movement
   - 6 Recoveries
   - 4 Xylem
   - 4 Supply
   - 4 Physical Defence (PD)
   - 4 Magical Defense (MD)
   - 5 Readied Equipment Slots
3. Choose a class from the list [here](classes.md) and note down its starting features. Note: Any background can pick any class, and your background has no bearing on your class's abilities.
4. If you wish to play as a non-human kin, choose now from the list [here](kin.md). Replace the applicable number of class features with your kin's features.
5. Choose a starting equipment kit from the list [here](kits.md). If your class has starting spells, also determine those. Note: Your class determines what starting equipment kits and spells you can choose from.
6. Improve one of the attack attack types (strike, shoot, shape, and alter) by 1.
