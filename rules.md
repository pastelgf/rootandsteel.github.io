# Core Rules

## The Adventure

The goal of Root and Steel is to go on adventures in order to get money. An adventure begins when a group of player characters, a party, leaves safety and travels into danger, and ends when they return to safety.

Adventures are split into two major phases: Exploration and Combat.

## Attributes

Characters have 4 attributes:
- Might, which is a representation of physical prowess and constitution.
- Agility, which is a representation of speed and deftness.
- Will, which is a representation of force of personality and belief.
- Lore, which is a representation of knowledge and intelligence.

Attributes cannot be higher than 4.

## Rolling and Hitting

All rolls in Root and Steel are performed with 2d6. 

Whenever 2d6 is rolled, it is against a target number, usually 8. Rolling at least this number is called a hit, and for every 2 points rolled higher than this number (10, 12, 14, etc) an additional hit is scored. This process is called a check.

In Exploration, whenever a character performs a check, they add the score of a relevant attribute, plus and additional +2 if they have a relevant background, a +2 if they have a relevant class, a +2 if they have a relevant kin, and a +2 for any relevant items in their inventory. The GM and player should agree what is relevant to the situation.

For example, Ismor the Outlander wants to bust down a locked wooden door. He has 3 Might, so he rolls 2d6 + 3, but he argues that his outlander class should make him good at busting down doors. His GM agrees, and so he rolls 2d6 + 5, and gets an 11, easily busting down the door.

Some tasks are very difficult. In order to succeed on these hard checks, a chaaracter must score at least 3 hits.

Ismor is now attempting to bust down a heavy iron portcullis. This is a difficult task, but Ismor feels up to it, rolling 2d6 + 5. He scores another 11, which is only 2 hits, clashing against the portcullis but failing to move it.

Note: a check should only be performed if the outcome for failure is INTERESTING or DIFFICULT. If it is neither, the character should automatically succeed at the task.

Characters can also interact with the world magically via [rituals](rituals.md).

## Backgrounds and Classes

[Backgrounds](backgrounds.md) represent what characters did before they were an adventurer. They are determined randomly during character creation, and determine a character's starting attributes as well as granting characters a starting gift.

A [class](classes.md) represents a part of how your character chooses to fight in combat. Any character can pick any class, regardless of background or attributes, as attributes have no bearing on your character in Combat, and your class has no bearing on Exploration except providing a bonus on applicable checks. Class is also chosen at character creation. Each class has 3 features, which can be further modified with feats, which are specific to each feature. Each feature may only have one feat.

If a character is not human, then they will replace one or two of their class features with their kin's features, which otherwise work like class features.

## Money and Value

The goal of adventuring is to gather money: usually in the form of coins called pieces. Pieces come in 4 values: copper, silver, gold, and gemstones, and also come in 4 sizes, pouch, bag, and chest. Each value is 4x more valuable than the previous, and each size is 4x more valuable than the previous.

All items in Root and Steel have their prices represented by one of these 5 values. Anything that would cost more cannot be purchased with coin, instead needing to be earned via adventure.

Towns and villages only sell items up to standard value. Cities only sell items up to valuable value. Capital cities can sell anything.

## Equipment

The vast majority of a character's options, both in Combat or Exploration, are defined by their [equipment](equipment.md). Equipment are stored in slots, which come in two forms: readied and unreadied.

A character starts with 5 readied slots, which represent the items they have on hand, and also the items they use in Combat. Unreadied slots represent the items a character is storing in a bag, or in an otherwise hard to reach place. Unreadied items are easily usable during Exploration, but not Combat. A character has a number of unreadied slots equal to 10 + their might score. Some equipment is consumable. Once used, it cannot be used again until the adventure is over, or until a character spends supplies to refresh it. Supplies represent the extra bits and bobs a character has on hand, which are only refreshed when an adventure is finished. A character does not need to repurchase consumed items, they are permanent.

All characters are assumed to have access to standard clothing which does not take up a slot.

A character's starting equipment will be defined by whichever [kit](kits.md) they pick. Kit choices are restricted based on class.

## Levelling Up

When a character collects an amount of money equal to a chest of gold through dangerous means, they level up. Money earned from a simple job does not count, the character must be risking their life for their coin. A character only levels up when an adventure is finished.

Every level a character levels up they gain 1 maximum xylem, as well as their choice of 1 maximum supplies or 1 maximum recovery.

At levels 2, 3, and 4 a character picks a feat for one of their class's or kin's features, or replaces a class feature with a different class' feature. You cannot replace all of your class' features this way. As well, a character improves one of the four attack types (strike, shoot, shape, alter) by 1.

At levels 5 and 10, a character also gains one attribute point, a new background of the player's choice, 4 hit points, and 1 readied slot.

## Resting

When a character is on an adventure, their ability to rest is limited. Every night a character spends with adequate access to food (a quarter slots worth of food) and with no interuptions, they regain 1 recovery.

When a character returns from an adventure and rests for a full week, all of their supplies, hit points, recoveries, and consumed items are restored.

## Light

Light represents the barrier between the world of breathing creatures, and the world of monsters. Whereas light is necessary for most beings to see, light is actively harmful towards monsters. Light comes in several tiers. During Exploration, any level of light is valid for allowing creatures to see, but during Combat, a low light level can empower enemies and weaken allies.

Torches are the most common form of light. They are generally lit at light level 3, bright, though can be lit at light level 4 with a brightbug.

When in light level 0, a character's only recourse is to run. Every turn spent in darkness increases a character's corruption (dark) by 1. See corruption rules [here](corruption.md).
