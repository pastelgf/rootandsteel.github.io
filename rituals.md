# Rituals

While spells represent solid and consistent forms of magic, rituals represent the opposite. Where as a fireball spell will always produce something equivalent to a fireball, a ritual can take many different forms based on the desires and wishes of the ritualist.

## Ritual Work

A character may know a number of rituals equal to their Lore score. Each ritual consists of a single phrase, up to 4 words in length, such as "open the path" or "find the lost one".

Given 10 minutes of uninterupted time, a character may perform a ritual they know to perform any effect which is within reason for the phrase of their ritual, and it must be something doable without magical means. Rituals are imprecise, and rarely perform exactly as intended.

For example, if a character might want to use the ritual "open the path" to find a path through a dense forest. As long as their GM agrees, this can be done, but by no means will the ritual create them the safest path, it will simply create them a path. The more specific the phrase of a ritual, the more likely it is to provide exactly what is asked of it.

The effects of a ritual last one day, unless the ritual is performed again. Each character may only perform one ritual per day.

## Learning Rituals

Rituals are learned through adventure in much the same way spells are. They are often found in dangerous places, but may be purchased or gained as a reward for a job well performed. 

If a character learns a ritual while already knowing their maximum amount, they may choose and forget one of their known rituals to learn the new one.
