# Combat

# The Basics

Combat takes place on a grid of 5ftx5ft tiles. Player characters and their foes alternate turns and use actions in order to defeat each other, usually by doing damage to the other side's health until it reaches 0. When a creature reaches 0 health, it dies.

After both the player characters and their foes have gone, a round has passed. A round representes approximately 10 seconds.

# Initiative

Initiative is side based, meaning that all creatures on either side of a combat go at the same time, however each creature must spend all of its actions before another creature can go. The side that goes first is determined by surprise. If one side surprises another, that side goes first. If no side is surprised, than the enemies go first.

# Actions 

Each turn, every character has 2 actions, which represent all the things they can manage on their turn. Enemies also use actions, but the number of actions they get is determined by the type of enemy, but otherwise they work the same. Each action can only be used once per turn, with the exception of the Move action. Below is a list of the common actions shared by all creatures, though other actions are grantedb y other sources, and enemies tend to have unique actions of their own.

# List of Actions

## Move

Move up to your movement. You can take this action twice in a turn, with the second one being known as Sprinting.

## Attack

Make an attack with a readied weapon. 

## Block

Use a readied shield to attempt to block. Damage you take this turn can be absorbed by the shield's durability. A shield with no durability cannot be used to block.

## Dodge

If you have no readied heavy armor, you can attempt to dodge attacks. All attacks against you have a 1-in-6 to automatically do nothing.

## Parry

If you have a readied weapon that can parry, you can attempt to do so. On the first attack against you before your next turn, make a check using your weapon's parry bonus (no other bonuses). On a hit, the attack does no damage and you may make a free attack on the target.

## Charge

You may move up to twice your movement in a straight line, then make an attack. The attack deals half damage if you moved less than your movement, normal damage if you moved at least your movement, and double damage if you moved the maximum amount. The first attack that hurts you before your next turn does +2 damage.

# Attacking

When a creature attacks, they use one of their readied weapons to deal damage to a creature within that weapon's range. Attacks automatically do damage and apply any special effects as a result of the used weapon or various abilities a creature has. Note, special effects are not applied if an attack does no damage.

# Maneuvers

When a character lands an attack that deals damage using the Attack action (and only the Attack action), they can attempt a maneuver. Maneuvers represent the specialized tactics and combat styles of a character.

Basic maneuvers are simple and easy to perform, providing helpful bonuses that can help a fight go smoother. Examples include:

- Tripping an enemy
- Pushing an enemy back
- Disarming an enemy
- Throwing sand at an enemy to disorient them

Basic maneuevers usually require a check, using any bonuses that might apply (but not attribute bonuses) and with an effect up to the GM's discretion.

An epic maneuver is the kind of battle shaping effect that could turn the tide of a losing battle. It's the kind of incredibly stunt that stories are told about. Examples include:

- Leaping off the back of a dragon to throw a spear into it's eye
- Cutting a man in half in order to scare off his comrades
- Cleaving through a group of enemies with a single swing of a greataxe

Like basic maneuvers, epic maneuvers usually require a check, albeit their effects should improve as more hits are gained. Again, effects are up to the GM's discretion.

Basic maneuvers can be performed any number of times, but epic maneuevers can only be performed once per day per character.

# Armor

Armor that is readied acts as a barrier against damage. Each piece of armor has a certain amount of durability, which is lowered when a creature takes damage instead of their health. If a character has multiple pieces of armor readied, it is up to them which piece takes damage.

Armor that is partially damaged can be fully repaired in a few mintues using supplies, but armor that is damaged to the point of 0 durability is too damaged to field repair. It can only be fixed at the end of the adventure, but costs nothing to do so.

Some attacks pierce armor, either partially or fully. These attacks ignore armor and deal damage directly to health. Armor piercing has no effect if the target is unarmored.

# Other Rules

## Cover and Low Visibility

A character that is behind cover, or is obscured by fog, mist, or a similar effect, takes 2 less damage on all ranged attacks.

## Fighting Blind

If you cannot see something, you cannot attack it.
