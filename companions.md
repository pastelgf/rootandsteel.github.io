# Companions

## Companion Rules

Companions are used to represent beings such as animals or intelligent undead that work alongside their owner, rather than being used by them. Animals can be used like any normal item for the purpose of resolving checks. Companions do not take up slots of their own (unless used in combat), but require a 1/4 slot of food per day to survive, same as a character.

## Companions in Combat

In order to use a companion in combat, a character must sacrifice readied slots, with a companion gaining one feature per sacrificed slot. Regardless of slots sacrificed, all companions have a basic attack, as well as base attributes as defiend by their type. In addition, all companions get a +1 to their attacks per level of their owner, up to level 4.

Companions actions are used the same as normal actions, however companions take up a tile as if they were a character, and are able to be attacked, downed, healed, and use recoveries, using the same rules as a character (if a companion's level is needed, use the level of their owner). In addition, companions get a free action every turn to move. Companions cannot take the move action normally. All companion actions originate from the companion, unless stated otherwise. Companions do not use xylem, but instead grant a new condition to their owner which is spent on their abilities: command.

Command X: Is spent to use companion abilities. Does not decay.
